Notably seen as one of the best children's novels, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' by Lewis Carroll comes at 8th place in the list. The book was first published in 1865, and since then it has sold 100 million copies worldwide. We all know the story of Alice and how she fell into the rabbit hole, just to find herself in wonderland where she encounters characters like the grinning Cheshire Cat who can vanish into thin air, the cryptic Mad Hatter who speaks in riddles and the harrowing Queen of Hearts obsessed with the phrase "Off with their heads!". The book has been made into several blockbuster films, animated films, and cartoon series.

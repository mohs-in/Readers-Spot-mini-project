This is the best-selling manga series of all time, launched in 1997 and still going strong. Written and drawn by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece is the frenetic and freewheeling tale of a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, leader of a gang of pirates on a world dominated by two vast oceans. Luffy and his crew seek the One Piece, the grand treasure that confers the title of King of All Pirates. Oda fuses fantasy, science fiction and old-fashioned pirate adventure â€“ together with a deep mythology all his own (there are three kinds of Devil Fruit, see, which grant different powers to the person who eats them, but those powers get canceled if the person is ever submerged in water.
